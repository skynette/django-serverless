		<p class="text-base mt-5 px-10">As for hosting this website on Vercel, it is a popular serverless hosting platform that allows you to easily deploy and run serverless functions and web applications. Vercel is built on top of the cloud infrastructure provider AWS, and provides a number of benefits for developers, such as automatic scaling, CDN caching, and a simple deployment process.</p>
		<p class="text-base mt-3 px-10">With serverless architecture, we no longer have to worry about managing infrastructure or scaling our application manually. Instead, we can focus on writing code and delivering value to our users, while leaving the underlying infrastructure to be managed by Vercel.</p>
